    <div class="about">
	<p>We believe that we can make the world a better place if we all contribute little quotas to help oneanother.</p>
	<p>With the End Hunger Campaign our goal is to feed at least 10,000 people per month and provide those who have the ability to work with sustainable skills/jobs so they would be able to feed themselves subsequently.</p>
<p>We believe that putting an end to hunger in Africa goes beyond just putting food in bellies but also making sure those bellies are never empty again.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this goal, we need all the help we can get from everyone including you. 
Join us as we make the world a better place for one and for all.</p>
